In-app purchases (IAP) are optional services that enhance Odoo databases. Each service provides its
own specific features and functionality. A full list of services is available on the `Odoo IAP
Catalog <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services>`_.

   :guilabel:`Documents Digitization` service digitizes scanned or PDF vendor bills, expenses, and

|IAP| services do **not** need to be configured or set up before use. Odoo users can simply click on
the service in the app to activate it. However, each service requires its own prepaid credits, and
when they run out, users **must** :ref:`buy more <iap/buying_credits>` in order to keep using it.

For more information on every service currently available, visit the `Odoo IAP Catalog
<https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services>`_.

Use IAP services
----------------

|IAP| services are automatically integrated with Odoo, and do **not** require users to configure any
settings. To use a service, simply interact with it wherever it appears in the database.

.. example::
   The following flow focuses on the *SMS* |IAP| service being used from a contact's record.

   This can be done by clicking the :guilabel:`üì± (phone) SMS` icon within the database.

   .. image:: in_app_purchase/sms-icon.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The SMS icon on a typical contact information form located within an Odoo database.

   One way to utilize the *SMS* |IAP| service with Odoo is showcased in the following steps:

   #. Navigate to the :menuselection:`Contacts application`, and click on a contact with a mobile
      phone number entered in either the :guilabel:`Phone` or :guilabel:`Mobile` field of the
      contact form.
   #. Hover the mouse over the :guilabel:`Phone` or :guilabel:`Mobile` field, and a :guilabel:`üì±
      (phone) SMS` icon appears to the right.
   #. Click the :guilabel:`üì± (phone) SMS` icon, and a :guilabel:`Send SMS Text Message` pop-up
      window appears.
   #. Type a message in the :guilabel:`Message` field of the :guilabel:`Send SMS Text Message`
      pop-up window. Then, click the :guilabel:`Send SMS` button. Odoo then sends the message, via
      SMS, to the contact, and logs what was sent in the *chatter* of the contact's form.

   Upon sending the SMS message, the prepaid credits for the *SMS* |IAP| service are automatically
   deducted from the existing credits. If there are not enough credits to send the message, Odoo
   prompts the user to purchase more.

   For more information on how to use various |IAP| services, and for more in-depth instructions
   related to SMS functionality in Odoo, review the documentation below:

   - :doc:`SMS essentials </applications/marketing/sms_marketing/essentials/sms_essentials>`

.. _in_app_purchase/credits:

IAP credits
===========

Every time an |IAP| service is used, the prepaid credits for that service are spent. Odoo prompts
the purchase of more credits when there are not enough credits left to continue using a service.
Email alerts can also be set up for when :ref:`credits are low <in_app_purchase/low-credits>`.

Credits are purchased in *Packs* from the `Odoo IAP Catalog
<https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services>`_, and pricing is specific to each service.

.. example::
   The `SMS service <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/1>`_ has four packs available, in
   denominations of:

   - :guilabel:`Starter Pack`: 10 credits
   - :guilabel:`Standard Pack`: 100 credits
   - :guilabel:`Advanced Pack`: 500 credits
   - :guilabel:`Expert Pack`: 1,000 credits

   .. image:: in_app_purchase/packs.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Four different packs of credits for the SMS IAP service.

   The number of credits consumed depends on the length of the SMS and the country of destination.
